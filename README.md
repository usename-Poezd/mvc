### src/
Framework extension point. This is where developers put their code. Implemented based on the MVC pattern. Controller - contains controllers. The entry point of all requests to the server and the subsequent formation of the response. Model - contains models. Gets data from various sources (DB, external api, etc.). Service - business logic layer. Contains code that is most likely to be refactored and modified. Generates json server response.
